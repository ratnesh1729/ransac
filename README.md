------- An implementation of RANSAC (C++-11) -------

1. This implementation requires C++-11 and uses STL and function pointers to encourage genericity.
   Please refer to the ransac.h file for details and the line.cpp for fitting 2d points to a line.

2. I provide the CMakeLists.txt for compilation, tested on ubuntu 64 bit. Should be able to work on windows too (need to compile again on windows).

3. The dataset for points is taken from scikit and is called foo.csv in the source folder.
